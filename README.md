# crates_io_api

A Rust client for the [crates.io](https://crates.io) API.

This crate aims to provide an easy to use and complete client for retrieving
detailed information about Rust's crate ecosystem.

The crate uses the [reqwest](https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest) HTTP client
and provides both a async and synchronous interface.

When accessing crates.io, please be respectful of the official 
[Crawler Policy](https://crates.io/policies#crawlers).

To make this easier, rate limiting is provided.
